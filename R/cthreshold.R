#' Familywise Type I Error Rate
#' 
#' Function to calculate the testwise type I error rate threshold corresponding
#' to a give familywise threshold.
#' 
#' @param alpha The familywise type I error threshold.
#' @param nbtest The number of tests performed.
#' 
#' @return The threshold that have to be used for individual tests.
#' 
#' @details Type I error rate inflation occurs when a single hypothesis is
#' tested indirectly using inferences about two or more (i.e., a family of)
#' sub-hypotheses. In such situation, the probability of type I error (i.e., the
#' probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis) of the single,
#' familywise, hypothesis is higher than the lowest, testwise, probabilities. As
#' a consequence, the rejection of null hypothesis for one or more individual
#' tests does not warrant that the correct decision (whether to reject the the
#' null hypothesis on a familywise basis) was taken properly. This function
#' allows to obtain correct, familywise, alpha thresholds in the context of
#' multiple testing. It is base on the Sidak inegality.
